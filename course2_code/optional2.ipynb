    "1) In lecture we define the length of a path to be the sum of the lengths of its edges. Define the bottleneck of a path to be the maximum length of one of its edges. A mininum-bottleneck path between two vertices ss and tt is a path with bottleneck no larger than that of any other $s-t$ path. Show how to modify Dijkstra's algorithm to compute a minimum-bottleneck path between two given vertices. The running time should be $O(m \\log n)$, as in lecture.\n",
